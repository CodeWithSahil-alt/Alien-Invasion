# 👾 Alien Invasion (Pygame Project)

A beginner-friendly 2D space shooter game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, following the "*Python Crash Course*" by *Eric Matthes*.  
This project is part of my preparation for **Google Summer of Code 2026**.

## 🚀 Current Features

### ✅ Game Window Initialized
- 1200x755 screen created using `pygame.display.set_mode()`
- Game loop running with proper event handling (`QUIT`)

### ✅ Ship Class Added
  - Loads a custom spaceship image.
  - Positions the ship at the bottom-center of the screen.
  - Renders the ship using the `blitme()` method.
  - Structured in a separate `Ship` class
  
### ✅ Bullet Firing System
  - Press spacebar to shoot bullets upward.
  - Bullets are drawn on screen and move continuously.
  - Uses `pygame.sprite.Sprite` for efficient handling.
  - Implemented using a `Bullet` class

### ✅ Alien Fleet Generation
- Created `Alien` class using `pygame.sprite.Sprite`
- Calculated number of aliens per row dynamically
- Aliens drawn in a fleet at the top of the screen
- Spawns a full alien fleet at the top of the screen.

### ✅ Alien Fleet Movement
- Aliens move horizontally as a fleet
- When a fleet hits the screen edge, it drops down and reverses direction
- Controlled using `check_edges()` in each alien and centralized `fleet_direction` in `Settings`
- Prepares the game for bullet-alien collisions and end conditions

### ✅ Bullet-Alien Collision Detection
- Bullets now detect and destroy aliens on contact
- Uses `pygame.sprite.groupcollide()` to efficiently manage collisions
- Entire fleet regenerates after all aliens are destroyed
- Sets the stage for scoring, levels, and win conditions

### ✅ Game Over & Lives System
- Tracks remaining ships using `GameStats`
- Game ends when all lives are lost
- Ships repositioned after being hit, with a short pause before play resumes

### 🆕 Play Button (NEW!)
- Interactive Play Button to start or restart the game.
- Hides the mouse cursor during gameplay for immersion.
- Click to reset stats, recreate fleet, and center the ship.
